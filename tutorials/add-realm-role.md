### Create Realm Roles

Applications often assign access and permissions to specific roles rather than individual users as dealing with users can be too fine grained and hard to manage.

Letâ€™s create "app-user" and "app-admin" Realm roles by assigning corresponding Client Roles: user, admin.

1. Click on the Roles menu from the left pane. All the available roles for the selected Realm will get listed here.

2. To create "app-user" realm role, click Add Role. You will be prompted for a Role Name, and a Description. Provide the details as below and Save.

3. Enabled Composite Roles and Search for `vanilla` under Client Roles field. Select user role of the `vanilla` client and Click Add Selected .

This configuration will assign `vanilla` client role : `user` to the `app-user` realm role.

4. Follow the same steps to create the app-admin realm role and assign `vanilla` client role : `admin` to it.
